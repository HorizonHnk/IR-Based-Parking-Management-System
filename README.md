# IR-Based Parking Management System
> Efficient vehicle tracking through digital counter technology

## System Overview
This project implements a comprehensive parking management solution using infrared (IR) sensors and digital counters. The system provides real-time monitoring of vehicle entry and exit, enabling accurate occupancy tracking for parking facilities of various sizes.

### Key Features
* **Bidirectional counting**: Accurate tracking of both entering and exiting vehicles
* **IR sensor detection**: Reliable vehicle presence detection
* **Digital display interface**: Clear occupancy indicators
* **Multiple counter implementations**: CD40110, 74LS192, and 74LS191 options
* **Threshold alerts**: Configurable capacity warnings
